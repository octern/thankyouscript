## Thank you, notifications ("thotifications")

This is an applescript to dismiss MacOS notifications without having to mouse over and fiddle with the disappearing dismiss / clear button. You can download the scpt file and run it with Automator or from Terminal, or you can copy the contents and run it from a launcher like Alfred. I like the latter solution, and have assigned it the command key ⌃⇧D

None of this is my original work. The code comes from StackExchange user lunzwell on [this post](https://apple.stackexchange.com/a/408602/20704) with a small addition I pulled from [this Apple forum post](https://discussions.apple.com/thread/6820749) to return focus when complete.
