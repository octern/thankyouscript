This is an applescript to dismiss MacOS notifications without having to mouse over and fiddle with the disappearing dismiss / clear button. You can run this with Automator, make it a shell script, and/or bind it to a hotkey using your favorite key-binding software (eg, Alfred)

None of this is my original work. The code comes from [this stackexchange post](https://apple.stackexchange.com/a/408602/20704) with a small addition I pulled from [this Apple forum post](https://discussions.apple.com/thread/6820749) to return focus when complete.
